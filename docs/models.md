# Model catalog

llmux exposes the **known** models — a curated set plus the live grok and
openrouter pins — as a machine-readable catalog. This is deliberately not an
exhaustive list of everything routable: at request time the grok provider
forwards ANY `grok-*` id verbatim and the openrouter provider forwards any
`or-<vendor>/<slug>` verbatim (see [alias semantics](#alias-semantics)), so a
request or config pin naming an id outside the curated set still works. Such an
out-of-catalog pin appears here as a **synthesized row** with null metadata (see
[out-of-catalog grok pin](#out-of-catalog-grok-pin) and
[out-of-catalog openrouter pin](#out-of-catalog-openrouter-pin)).

## Endpoints

- `GET /models`
- `GET /llmux/models`

Both return the **same** payload and sit behind the same loopback + proxy
api-key gate as every other route:

```json
{ "models": [ /* ModelEntry, ... */ ] }
```

Registering root `/models` reserves a path that previously fell through to the
upstream proxy fallback. Anthropic exposes no root `/models`, and `/v1/models`
is left untouched (still proxied upstream), so nothing regresses.

## Response schema

Each element of `models` is a `ModelEntry`:

| Key           | Type                | Meaning                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | string              | Concrete upstream model id.                                   |
| `aliases`     | array of strings    | Extra request slugs that resolve to this id (may be empty).   |
| `name`        | string              | Human-facing display name.                                    |
| `efforts`     | array of strings    | Accepted `reasoning.effort` values, low→high (may be empty).  |
| `max_context` | integer or `null`   | Context window in tokens; `null` when unpublished.            |
| `group`       | string              | Backend group: `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, or `openrouter`.    |

`max_context: null` means the context window is not published for that id —
not that it is zero.

## Alias semantics

- **grok family alias** — `"grok"` is dynamic: it attaches to whichever grok id
  is the current live pin (`POST /llmux/grok` / `config.grok.default_model`). A
  bare `grok` request routes to that pin, so the catalog advertises the alias on
  exactly the pinned entry. Any `grok-*` id also passes through verbatim.
- **codex variant aliases** — `sol` / `terra` / `luna` resolve to the latest gpt
  generation of that variant (`gpt-5.6-sol` / `-terra` / `-luna`), and the bare
  `gpt-5.6` id resolves to the `sol` flagship. These are advertised statically
  on the corresponding entries.
- **claude aliases** — the claude rows carry short user-curated aliases that
  both ROUTE to the claude group and are RESOLVED by the proxy: a bare alias is
  rewritten to its catalog id before the request leaves llmux, so the alias
  `GET /models` advertises is actually honored upstream.

  | request slug     | catalog id            | model on the wire  |
  | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
  | `fable`, `fable-5-1` | `claude-fable-5-1[1m]` | `claude-fable-5-1` |
  | `opus`, `opus-5` | `claude-opus-5[1m]`   | `claude-opus-5`    |
  | `sonnet`, `sonnet-5` | `claude-sonnet-5[1m]` | `claude-sonnet-5` |
  | `haiku`          | `claude-haiku-4-5`    | `claude-haiku-4-5` |

  Matching is trimmed and case-insensitive (`"  OPUS  "` resolves), and an
  alias may carry the client-side `[1m]` context suffix — `fable[1m]` resolves
  exactly like `fable`, because alias resolution runs before the suffix strip.
  That strip is syntactic only — it does not promise a 1M-capable target
  (`haiku[1m]` resolves to the ordinary `claude-haiku-4-5` row).
  Only aliases are rewritten: a real catalog id is not an alias and passes
  through untouched — the `[1m]` suffix strip is a separate, subsequent step,
  which is why `claude-opus-5[1m]` still reaches upstream as `claude-opus-5` —
  and foreign slugs (`grok-4.6`, `gpt-5.6-sol`) are never rewritten. The
  mapping has a single source, the `CLAUDE_MODELS` const in `src/catalog.rs` behind
  `resolve_claude_alias`; adding a curated row carries its aliases
  automatically. llmux still does not otherwise *shape* claude requests, and the
  `efforts` menu on claude rows is the Claude Code `/effort` level list, per the
  user contract.
- **openrouter `or-` aliases** — the openrouter rows advertise the id a client
  SENDS (`or-ox-alpha`); the OpenRouter slug it is rewritten to on the wire
  (`stealth/ox-alpha`) is a different string, because the advertised id has to
  carry the `or-` prefix that routes the request to the openrouter group in the
  first place. The curated mapping:

  | request slug                | model on the wire                        |
  | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
  | `or-ox-alpha`               | `stealth/ox-alpha`                       |
  | `or-free`                   | `openrouter/free`                        |
  | `or-glm-5.2`                | `z-ai/glm-5.2:free`                      |
  | `or-nemotron-3-ultra`       | `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free` |
  | `or-nemotron-3.5-lightning` | `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning:free`     |
  | `or-dots-3-note`            | `dots-studio/dots-3-note-preview:free`   |
  | `or-laguna-s-2.1`           | `poolside/laguna-s-2.1:free`             |
  | `or-north-mini-code`        | `cohere/north-mini-code:free`            |
  | `or-gemma-4-31b`            | `google/gemma-4-31b-it:free`             |
  | `or-gpt-oss-20b`            | `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`                |

  Three rules sit around that table, and the table is a convenience layer, not
  a gate:

  - **bare `or`** — like bare `grok`, it resolves to the live pin
    (`config.openrouter.default_model`, default `stealth/ox-alpha`), and so
    does a request that names no model at all.
  - **`or-<vendor>/<slug>` escape hatch** — anything containing a `/` is used
    VERBATIM minus the `or-` selector, so the ~400 OpenRouter models outside
    the curated set are reachable: `or-openai/gpt-oss-20b:free` →
    `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`. A bare `openrouter/…` slug also routes here and
    rides through unchanged.
  - **no silent substitution** — an uncurated bare name passes through as it
    was typed, so OpenRouter's own 404 reaches the user instead of llmux
    answering from a model nobody asked for.

  Matching is trimmed and case-insensitive, and one trailing `[1m]` is stripped
  first, exactly as on the claude and codex paths.
- **alias stability** — aliases float to the current generation, ids do not.
  `opus` tracks the newest curated Opus and moved from `claude-opus-4-8[1m]` to
  `claude-opus-5[1m]` on 2026-07-27 (4.8 stays in the catalog; it just no longer
  owns an alias). Anyone who needs one specific model must send its full catalog
  id — that is the stable handle. Usage and pricing are booked against the
  resolved id, not the alias, so alias traffic lands on the same row as id
  traffic.

### Out-of-catalog grok pin

The curated grok set is `grok-4.6` (the default pin) and `grok-4.5`.
`config.grok.default_model` may pin ANY
`grok-*` slug — including ids not in the curated table below (e.g.
`grok-4.3`, `grok-code-fast-1`). Because the provider forwards such ids
verbatim, the pin is real and routable, so the `"grok"` family alias must have
an owner. When the pin matches no curated id, the catalog appends a
**synthesized** grok row: `id` = the pin, `name` = the pin verbatim, `aliases`
= `["grok"]`, `efforts` from the thinking-level lookup (empty unless the id is a
known reasoner — e.g. pinning `grok-4.3` yields `none, low, medium, high`), and
`max_context` = `null`. The null metadata reflects that llmux has no published
context/name for an id it does not curate.

### Out-of-catalog openrouter pin

`config.openrouter.default_model` may pin ANY OpenRouter slug, including one
outside the curated table below — the provider forwards it verbatim, so the pin
is real and routable and the bare `or` alias must have an owner. When the pin
matches no curated row's wire slug, the catalog appends a **synthesized**
openrouter row: `id` = `or-<pin>` (the string a client can actually type),
`name` = the pin verbatim, `aliases` = `["or"]`, `efforts` = empty, and
`max_context` = `null` — llmux has no published context or effort menu for a
model it does not curate.

"grok (pinned)" means the `grok` alias appears on that row only while it is the
live grok pin; any other pinned `grok-*` id appears instead as a synthesized row
(see [Out-of-catalog grok pin](#out-of-catalog-grok-pin)). "or (pinned)" reads
the same way for the openrouter pin (see
[Out-of-catalog openrouter pin](#out-of-catalog-openrouter-pin)); with the
default pin it sits on `or-ox-alpha`. The openrouter ids are what a client
sends — the slug that reaches OpenRouter is the one in the
[alias table](#alias-semantics), and every curated openrouter row is a free
model (priced `$0` in and out; an UNCURATED openrouter model has no known
rate and is reported unpriced, never as a free `$0`).

### The codex `[1m]` rows

`gpt-5.6-sol[1m]` / `gpt-5.6-terra[1m]` are the codex side of the same `[1m]`
convention the claude rows use: the suffix is a **client-side context-denominator
opt-in**, not a different upstream model. Claude Code parses it out of the
configured model string to size its context readout; llmux strips one trailing
`[1m]` before resolving the model, so upstream never sees it and
`gpt-5.6-sol[1m]` reaches the backend as `gpt-5.6-sol`. The strip happens ahead
of every resolution rule, so a suffixed alias works too (`sol[1m]` →
`gpt-5.6-sol`), and it applies to routing as well (`sol[1m]` classifies to the
codex group exactly like `sol`). A client that sends the id verbatim — curl, an
SDK — gets the model it asked for instead of falling back to the configured pin.

The advertised 1000000 is the opt-in denominator; the measured upstream input
ceiling is close to it. Probes 2026-08-21 against the ChatGPT-account codex
backend accepted 555,029 / ~801k / ~869k / 910,229 input tokens on
`gpt-5.6-sol` and were rejected at ~936k with `Your input exceeds the context
window of this model` (`gpt-5.6-terra` accepted 555,029). OpenAI publishes
1,050,000 total for the gpt-5.6 family. The base rows keep the openai/codex
catalog's 372000 — the window a client gets without opting in — exactly as the
claude base rows keep 200000 next to their `[1m]` twins. There is deliberately
no `gpt-5.6-luna[1m]` (luna still returns "Model not found" upstream) and no
`gpt-5.5[1m]` row (272k family).

## Sources

Evidence gathered 2026-07-14; the claude rows and their aliases were re-curated
2026-07-27, the codex context windows were re-probed 2026-08-21 (the codex
effort menus are unchanged from 2026-07-14), and the grok rows were re-probed
2026-08-26 (unchanged — see below).

- **Claude rows** — user-curated 2026-07-27 from the Claude Code model picker.
  The `[1m]` suffix marks the 1M-context variant ids. Effort menus are the
  Claude Code `/effort` levels (`low, medium, high, xhigh, max`), applied per
  the user contract; llmux does not itself shape claude requests. The claude
  rows now live as the `CLAUDE_MODELS` const in `src/catalog.rs`, which is also
  the source for alias→id resolution in `src/provider/anthropic.rs`.
- **Codex effort menus and base context windows** — the openai/codex model
  catalog (`models-manager/models.json`), fetched 2026-07-14. `gpt-5.6-sol` /
  `-terra` support low→ultra; `gpt-5.6-luna` low→max; `gpt-5.5` low→xhigh
  (context 272000). The legacy `gpt-5.5-codex` / `gpt-5-codex` ids are no longer
  curated.
- **Codex `[1m]` context window** — live probes through the daemon against the
  ChatGPT-account codex backend, 2026-08-21: `gpt-5.6-sol` accepted 910,229
  input tokens and was rejected at ~936k (`Your input exceeds the context window
  of this model`); `gpt-5.6-terra` accepted 555,029. This supersedes the earlier
  "369,755 pass / ~380k rejected" note that made 372000 look probe-confirmed.
- **OpenRouter rows** — the live `GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`
  probe on 2026-08-21: 420 models, 21 of them with `pricing.prompt == "0"`; the
  ten curated rows take their wire slug, display name, `max_context`, and
  effort menu (`reasoning.supported_efforts`, re-sorted low→high) from that
  response. They are the `OPENROUTER_MODELS` const in `src/catalog.rs`, which
  is also the source for `or-…` → slug resolution in
  `src/provider/openrouter.rs`. The design record, including the probe evidence
  that OpenRouter serves a NATIVE Anthropic Messages endpoint, is
  [`openrouter/spec.md`](openrouter/spec.md).
- **Grok context window / name** — the live `cli-chat-proxy` `/v1/models` probe
  2026-07-14 (`grok-4.5` ctx 500000). The `grok-4.6` row was verified the same
  way against the live `cli-chat-proxy` `/v1/models` on 2026-08-13 (ctx 500000,
  efforts `low, medium, high, xhigh`) and re-probed unchanged on 2026-08-26 with
  a real subscription token: `grok-4.6` `reasoning_efforts` `xhigh, high,
  medium, low` (upstream default `high`, ctx 500000), `grok-4.5` `high, medium,
  low` — no `xhigh` — ctx 500000. That asymmetry is why an above-`high` request
  keeps `xhigh` on `grok-4.6` and clamps to `high` on `grok-4.5`. Grok effort
  menus come from the provider's per-model thinking-level table. The curated
  grok set is `grok-4.6` (the default pin) and `grok-4.5`; other known grok ids
  (`grok-4.3`, `grok-3-mini`, …) pass through at request time and synthesize a
  null-metadata row when pinned.
