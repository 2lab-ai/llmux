# Schedulers

Which account serves the next request is decided by the scheduler. Two algorithms ship; switch live with `S` in the TUI (persisted to `scheduler.mode`), or `POST /llmux/scheduler-mode {"mode": "default" | "round-robin"}`.

**Why switching matters:** the upstream prompt cache is scoped per account — every account switch invalidates it, and the next request re-reads the full conversation context uncached (token cost + latency). Both schedulers are therefore sticky on the current account; they differ in *when* they move and *who* is next.

## Eligibility (both modes)

An account can be picked only when ALL of these hold — the same pure gate drives selection, the TUI status column, and `/llmux/status`, so they can never disagree:

- auth healthy, not operator-**paused** (`p` in the TUI switcher, context menu in llmux-islands)
- not cooling down (429 `retry-after` park)
- 5h utilization ≤ `scheduler.five_hour_max` (default **0.90**)
- 7d utilization ≤ `scheduler.seven_day_max` (default **0.99**)
- usage data fresh (≤ `usage_max_age_secs`; if ALL accounts are stale, the gate degrades to headers-only mode instead of stalling)

Per-account overrides: `account_limits` in the config (TUI: `L` in the switcher, `"90,98,98"` = 5h,7d,fbl percents) replace any of the three ceilings for that account.

**Fable scope:** Fable-family requests are additionally refused an account whose Fable weekly bucket is constraining (≥ `scheduler.fable_weekly_max`, default **0.98**, reset-aware) or Fable-cooling. Non-Fable traffic ignores Fable state entirely — a Fable-exhausted account still serves everything else. Full Fable lane mechanics: [fable-scheduling.md](fable-scheduling.md).

## `default` — quota-maximizing

Ranks eligible accounts by `score = servable_now × urgency`: `servable_now` = min(5h, 7d headroom below the ceilings) — the binding limit wins; `urgency` = 1–4× as the 7d reset approaches — soon-to-reset budget is perishable, so it burns first, while long-runway accounts are preserved as reservoirs. Sticky on the current account, but proactively switches when another account scores >25% higher (`SWITCH_MARGIN`) — it trades some cache locality for not letting quota expire unused.

## `round-robin` — sequential exhaust (fewest switches)

Stays on the current account until it is **hard ineligible** (ceiling hit, cooldown, auth, pause) — never a proactive switch — then moves to the **next account in roster order**, wrapping. Deterministic, score-free, and the minimum possible number of switches, at the cost of letting other accounts' soon-to-reset quota expire unused. Pick this when prompt-cache locality (long agent sessions) matters more than squeezing every window.

## Adding a scheduler

The selection logic is pure and lives in `src/scheduler/select.rs` (`pick_scoped`, `rank`, `round_robin_next`) — deterministic functions of `(PoolSnapshot, SelectParams, now)`, unit-tested without IO. To add a mode: extend `SchedulerMode` in `src/config/schema.rs`, branch in `pick_scoped`/`next_in_line`/`selection_order`, and document it here.

The full derivation, edge cases, and the wasted-quota simulation behind the `default` policy live in [`.prd/09-scheduler-perishability.md`](../.prd/09-scheduler-perishability.md).
